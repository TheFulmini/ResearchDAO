# ResearchDAO
A DAO that allows researcher to look for funds and funders to choose projects.

A University Researcher can propose a thesis he wants to work on and ask for funding. 
He sets a goal, an NFT representing the project is minted. (This NFT is linked to the certificate, or is the certificate, linked to the IPs emerging of the research).
If goal not met, funds are transfered back to the funders addresses. (GL for next try).
If goal is met, NFT certificate creates an NFT collection that represents the governance token for the decisions regarding the IP. (if for profit research, these NFTs represent rigths to revenue and decision of use, if non profit they are simple governance tokens).
The DAOs unlocks the funds for the research and the work can begin.


Steps:

1. Propose Project.
2. Create ProjectDAO.
3. Fund the project
4. If objective reached, mint NFT.
5. Source NFT generates Governance NFT (ERC1155 ?)
6. ?
7. Profit

Using speicified DAOs we will create NFTs representing projects and voting power on the business decision of the research. This will allow for a secured, automated funding platform for different projects.
